Hello, I'm MrBones, I like open source stuff (I use Arch BTW)
I've been getting into game dev recently and as you might be able to guess, I'm using Godot. 
(more specifically godot-mono for now because sometimes I just wanna use C#)

Apart from that most of my free goes to playing other peoples video games.
